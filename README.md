<h2>About Me:</h2>

- Why Cybersecurity? <br>

 I am an individual with a high level of dedication and a strong interest in enhancing my skills in the areas that pique my interest. This certainly includes the cybersecurity space.
 My best skill is putting in the hours for any goal I want to accomplish, and I do it with complete trust in myself. Whatever the distance or difficulty, I will get there.
 I place high value on protecting the privacy of data and like to customize and optimize relevant procedures, preferably in a team environment. A second or third opinion is always helpful to ensure 
 that all security goals are met, and any possible angle is covered.
 I believe that the most advantageous aspect of the field of cybersecurity is that I will never run out of things to learn. Practicing new tasks, applications and techniques is always exciting to me. 
 Thankfully, there will always be innovation and thus, new things to learn.

<br>
- Other hobbies:

<br><p> üèê Volleyball<p/>
  I have been playing volleyball for 15 years now and play in the Regionalliga, which is 1 League below the 3.Bundesliga. The sport starts to become professional at the 2. Bundesliga level in Germany.
  I also go to the gym frequently to stay fit, healthy and enhance my volleyball skills.

<br><p> üéπ Music</p>
  Music has also played a vital role in my life. I am able to play the piano (14 years of experience) and guitar (4 years of experience). I was a freelancing movie composer for several years.

  

  <br><p> üéÆ Gaming</p>

  I am a passionate and long time gamer. From 2014 to 2018 I was a progamer in Starcraft 2 reaching rank 1 on the European server for some time, and even took part in boot camps which took place in Seoul, Southkorea. I lived there for a few months before returning back to Germany.
  I've also reached the highest ranks in Counter Strike GO and League of Legends. Some people would probably consider this a waste of time, but I am actually very proud of what I achieved and all 
  the experiences I made along the way. All this took a lot of effort, sweat and tears, but when I set out to do something, I commit to it with all my heart. While I game less and less nowadays, I still use it to unwind after a long day of working/learning. 

  
  <br><p> üßëüèº‚Äçüé®Painting</p>

  I love digital and nondigital painting. Here are two paintings I made a while back using Photoshop and a graphic-tablet.
